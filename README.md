This is an arduino project that involves a mobile robot that is capable of traversing difficult terrain along with obstacle detection and basic robotic arm lift and drop capability. UltraSonic sensors and IR sensors were used for obstacle detection. A Bluetooth module was also installed to give remote status commands to the robot using an android phone.
